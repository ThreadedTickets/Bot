# Threaded

## Self Hosting

This is a little more complicated as you will also require the bridge server, website and api. I'll fill out this section at some point

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute to Threaded. Simply make a new branch with your update and feel free to open up a pull request and I will review it when i can.

## Roadmap

Kinda just some features I'm thinking of adding:

- [ ] Better looking transcripts (things like proper discord style rendering)
- [ ] Tagging tickets (to allow staff to search for tickets more easily)
- [ ] Ticket automation (things like the closing tickets on leave but farrrrr more advanced)
- [ ] Statistic system
